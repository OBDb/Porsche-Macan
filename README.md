Key improvements include a redesigned exterior with more modern Porsche design language, completely revamped interior with the latest Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system, and updated powertrain options with improved efficiency and performance. The second generation continues to offer various performance variants including the Macan, Macan T, Macan S, Macan GTS, and starting in 2024, the all-electric Macan Electric with dual motors and 800V architecture, signifying Porsche's shift toward electrification in their lineup.
